Business Problem: Analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns on Zomato to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Project Summary:
The project aims to analyze customer behavior and purchase patterns on Zomato to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. By leveraging the provided data, several key insights can be derived:

1. Total amount spent by each customer on Zomato can be calculated by summing the prices of the purchased products.
2. The number of days visited by each customer can be determined by calculating the duration between their first and last visit dates.
3. The first product purchased by each customer can be identified by sorting the sales data and selecting the product with the earliest date.
4. The most frequently purchased item on the menu can be determined by aggregating the sales data and counting the occurrences of each product.
5. The most popular item for each customer can be identified by grouping the sales data by customer and product and counting the occurrences.
6. The first purchase made by a customer after joining the gold program can be found by filtering the sales data based on the gold signup date.
7. The last purchase made by a customer before joining the gold program can be identified by filtering the sales data based on the gold signup date.
8. The total orders and amount spent by each member before joining the gold program can be calculated by aggregating the sales data before the gold signup date.
9. Points collected by each customer based on product purchases can be calculated by multiplying the price of each product by its corresponding purchasing points.
10. To determine which customer earned more points in the first year after joining the gold program, the sales data within the first year can be analyzed to calculate the points earned based on the amount spent.

These insights can provide valuable information for Zomato to optimize their offerings, enhance customer experience, and develop targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention and satisfaction.
